# LicensePlateImage_ThresholdFiltered
From some files of images and labels obtained by applying the project presented at https://github.com/ashok426/Vehicle-number-plate-recognition-YOLOv5, the images of license plates are filtered through a threshold that allows a better recognition of the license plate numbers by pytesseract.
